You can access the *groups and permissions* management interface from the webadmin
by going into the 'Users' section and clicking the corresponding button:

![](./images/button_to_go_to_permission_interface.png)

## Managing groups

The group mechanism can be used to define groups of users which then can be used to restrict permissions for applications and other services (such as mail or XMPP). Note that it is *not* mandatory to create a group to do so: you can also restrict access to an app or service on a user-per-user basis.

Using groups is however useful for semantics, for example if you host multiple groups of friends, associations or businesses on your server, you might want to create groups like `association1` and `association2` and add members of each association to the relevant group.

### Default groups

By default, two special groups are created:
- `all_users`, that contain all users registered on YunoHost,
- `visitors`, that applies to people viewing the server while not logged in. 

The content of those groups cannot be changed, only the permissions given to them.

### List existing groups

The existing groups are listed at the top of the *groups and permissions* page.

![](./images/groups_default-groups.png)

To list the currently existing groups in CLI :

```shell
$ yunohost user group list
groups:
  all_users:
    members:
      - alice
      - bob
      - charlie
      - delphine
```


### Creating a new group

To create a new group, simply click on the "New Group" button at the top of the page. You may only choose a name formed with letters (uper- and lowercase) and spaces. The group is created empty and without any permission.

![](./images/groups_button-new-group.png)

In CLI, to create a new group called `yolo_crew`

```shell
$ yunohost user group create yolo_crew
```

### Updating a group

Let's add a first to this group: in the group panel, click the button "add a user" and scroll to the desired user, then click on it.

![](./images/groups_button-add-user.png)

To remove a user, click on the cross next to their username, in the group panel.

![](./images/groups_button-remove-user.png)

In CLI, use the following command to add `charlie` and `delphine`to the `yolo_crew` group:

```shell
$ yunohost user group update yolo_crew --add charlie delphine
```

(similarly, `--remove` can be used to remove members from a group)

Now in the group list we should see:

```shell
$ yunohost user group list
groups:
  all_users:
    members:
      - alice
      - bob
      - charlie
      - delphine
  yolo_crew:
    members:
      - charlie
      - delphine
```

### Deleting groups

To delete a group, click on the red cross on the top right of the group panel. You will be asked for confirmation.

![](./images/groups_button-delete-group.png)

To delete the group `yolo_crew` in CLI, you may run

```shell
$ yunohost user group delete yolo_crew
```

## Managing permissions

The permission mechanism allow to restrict access to services (for example mail, XMPP...) and apps, or even specific parts of the apps (for example the administration interface of WordPress).

### List permissions

The groups page lists the permissions given to each group, including the special groups `all_users` and `visitors`.

![](./images/groups_default-with-permissions.png)

To list permissions and corresponding accesses in CLI:

```shell
$ yunohost user permission list
permissions:
  mail.main:
    allowed: all_users
  wordpress.admin:
    allowed:
  wordpress.main:
    allowed: all_users
  xmpp.main:
    allowed: all_users
```

Here, we find that all registered users can use email, XMPP, and access the WordPress blog. However, nobody can access the WordPress admin interface.

More details can be displayed by adding the `--full` option which will display the list of users corresponding to groups allowed, as well as urls associated to a permission (relevant for web apps).

### Add accesses to group or users

To add a permission to a group, simply click the "+" button in the group panel, scroll to the desired permission, then click on it.

![](./images/groups_add-permission-group.png)

To allow a group to access the WordPress admin interface in CLI:

```shell
$ yunohost user permission update wordpress.admin --add yolo_crew
```

Note that you can also allow a single user, by using the specific panel at the bottom of the page.

![](./images/groups_add-permission-user.png)

or in CLI:

```shell
$ yunohost user permission update wordpress.admin --add alice
```

And now we may see that both the YoloCrew and Alice have access to the WordPress admin interface:

```shell
$ yunohost user permission list
  [...]
  wordpress.admin:
    allowed:
      - yolo_crew
      - alice
  [...]
```

Note that, for example, if we want to restrict permission for email so that only Bob is allowed to email, we should also remove `all_users` from the permission, by deleting it from the `all_users` group panel, or in CLI:

```shell
$ yunohost user permission update mail --remove all_users --add bob
```

Note that some permissions may be "protected", meaning that you won't be able to add/remove the visitor group to this permission. Generally, this is because it would make no sense (or is a security risk) to do so.

The webadmin will issue a warning if you set a permission that is superseeded by a wider permission.

![](./images/groups_alerte-permission.png)

### Hide/display specific tiles in the user portal

Since yunohost 4.1, you can choose to hide/display specific tiles in the SSO. In the webadmin, you can do so by going in the corresponding app view, go in "Manage label and tiles" and check/uncheck the option "Display the tile in the user portal" for the corresponding permission. In command line, this may be done with :

```shell
# Enable the tile for the wordpress admin interface
$ yunohost user permission update wordpress.admin --show_tile True
```


Notes for apps packagers
------------------------

Installing an app creates the permission `app.main` with `all_users` allowed by default.

If you wish to make the application publicly available, instead of the old `unprotected_urls` mechanism, you should give access to the special group `visitors`:

```shell
ynh_permission_update --permission "main" --add visitors
```

If you wish to create a custom permission for your app (e.g. to restrict access to an admin interface) you may use the following helpers:

```shell
ynh_permission_create --permission "admin" --url "/admin" --allowed "$admin_user" --label "Label for your permission"
```

You don't need to take care of removing permissions or backing up/restoring them as it is handled by the core of YunoHost.

### Migrating away from the legacy permission management

When migrating/fixing an app still using the legacy permission system, it should be understood that the accesses are now to be managed by features from the core, outside of the application scripts!

Application scripts are only expected to:
- if relevant, during the install script, initialize the main permission of the app as public (`visitors`) or private (`all_users`) or only accessible to specific groups/users ;
- if relevant, create and initialize any other specific permission (e.g. to some admin interface) in the install script (and *maybe* in some migration happening in the upgrade script).

Applications scripts should absolutely **NOT** mess up with any already-existing app accesses (including `unprotected`/`skipped_uris` settings) during any other case, as *it would reset any admin-defined access rule*!

When migrating away from the legacy permission, you should:
- remove any management of `$is_public`-like or `$admin_user`-like setting, except for any manifest question meant to either *initialize* the app as public/private or specific permissions ;
- remove the old legacy permissions. Check out the recommended way to proceed in the example_ynh app (in particular [this code snippet](https://github.com/YunoHost/example_ynh/pull/111/files#diff-57aeb84da86cb7420dfedd8e49bc644fb799d5413d01927a0417bde753e8922f))

It should boil down to : 
```bash
if ynh_legacy_permissions_exists; then
	ynh_legacy_permissions_delete_all

	ynh_app_setting_delete --app=$app --key=is_public

	# Create the permission using the new framework (if your app has relevant additional permissions)
	ynh_permission_create --permission="admin" --url="/admin" --allowed=$admin
fi
```

- remove any call to `yunohost app addaccess` and similar actions that are now obsolete and deprecated.
- if your app use LDAP and support filter, use the filter `'(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(permission=cn=YOUR_APP.main,ou=permission,dc=yunohost,dc=org))'` to allow users who have this permission. (A complete documentation of LDAP [here](https://moulinette.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ldap.html) if you want to undestand how it works with YunoHost)

#### Additional features from 4.1

- Label customization : this is the name displayed to end users in the user portal. You can provide a default label (for example app.admin maybe be labelled 'Admin interface'). The label may be changed later by the admin after installation.
- Enabling/disabling tile : this toggles wether or not an app is shown in the user portal (if the user has the corresponding permission). The corresponding option is called `show_tile` which may be `True` or `False`. A single app may have multiple tiles in the SSO. The url of each tile corresponds to the `url` parameter of the permission.
- Multiple url support: a permission may have additional urls associated to it. This give the possiblity to protect many url with the same permission - in particular for tricky use case (for example several pieces of admin interfaces spread over different subpaths).
- Protecting permission: As a packager, you may choose to "protect" a permission if you believe that it's not relevant for the admin to add/remove this permission to/from the visitors group. For example, this is the case for the API permission of Nextcloud, which in the vast majority of cases should be kept publicly because mobile client won't go through the SSO. Note that when using the helper `ynh_permission_update`, it's still possible to add/remove the `visitor` group of this permission.
- Disabling auth header: some app authentification mecanism do not appreciate that SSOwat injects the Authorization header (which is an essential mecanism for single sign-on). You can now choose to disable the auth header injection from SSOwat to fix this (instead of the previous hack of using `skipped_uris`)

##### Correspondance between the old and new permission mecanism

|             | with auth header | no auth header |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :------------- |
| **public**  | unprotected_uris | skipped_uris   |
| **private** | protected_uris   | N/A            |

|             | with auth header                            | no auth header                               |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| **public**  | auth_header=True, visitor group allowed     | auth_header=False, visitor group allowed     |
| **private** | auth_header=True, visitor group not allowed | auth_header=False, visitor group not allowed |


All of theses feature are managable by theses following helper:
- `ynh_permission_create`
- `ynh_permission_url`
- `ynh_permission_update`
